# Project_Dodge

Hey everyone! this is a small game written in C# using UWP. This was the first project I`ve done during my studies at Sela College. Nothing spesial, but I am very proud of it.
It was written with very limited knowledge about C#, UWP itself, and 50 to 60 persent of the time developing this program I spent googling and reading Microsoft documentation and basically learning on my own basics of programing, the OOP and problem solving.

The game was inspired by a Covid19 lockdowns and staying safe during the pandemic.

In this game you have your character, who will run away from viruses, and if your character is caught by a virus, you are infected, and have to try again to stay safe. If you make two viruses collide, one of them dissapiar, and you win, when there is only one left.
That was the basic project i had to do in order to get a good grate for my work... But.

I've fulfilled the requirements, and it just didn`t seem right to me to stay seated and to do nothing. The deadline was in a week. So...

I thought, how would I change the game for myself to enjoy? the idea was a great time killer, so it needed a few touches. So it got some.

First of all, the game needs to last longer, so - endless mode. It needs to be competitive amongst your friends - highest score. You need to have some second chanses - a vaccine, wich works just like a second life in any game you have ever played. And a burget, to get a superpower and +500 to score. You wanted challenge or chill? different difficulties are all you need, and you got it.

I am very proud of this project not because of great idea and usefulness' not because of great architecture, but because it really opened my mind to what programing is about, how the basics work and found my passion to code, solve issues and create.
